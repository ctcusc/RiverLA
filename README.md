# RiverLA Volunteer Match

This application automates RiverLA's Volunteer Facilitation Program.

## Setting up your development environment

We highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your development environment. It comes with a good amount of useful functionality out of the box. Additionally, the following extensions are quite useful:

- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- ESLint
- GitLens
